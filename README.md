## Developed with üõ†Ô∏è
 - Typescript V4.1.3
 - Node.js v12.18.1
## Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
This project is built based on the clean architecture of Robert C. Martin.  
 - Starting by defining the domain layer:
	 - Entities:
		 - Employee, Payment, Formatters  
		 - EmployeFacade for the employee payment process  
		 - In this layer I seek to use decoupling the Payment with the Employee so that the software is maintainable in the future.  
	- Use cases:  
		- Logic of the application, I use the repository and join it with the business entities.  
	- Controller:  execute the use case.  
	- Presenters:  Convert the data to a viewable format  
		- CLIPresenter, RESTPresenter, UIPresenter  
	- Abstractions: Repository interfaces  
- Detail layer:  
	- Repositories:  In this case only the FileRepository was used  
	- Views:  CLIPresenter, RESTPresenter (rest and ui)
